# Art Direction
Discuss the design techniques to be used. Describe the look & shape of the characters, environment and pathways. Will the game look realistic or have some other art style. Discuss what type of theme the game will have & what type of emotional impact you are hoping players experience. Discuss how the playerâ€™s gestures/interactivity has an affect on the visual experience. 

Present a general overview of the UI. How will the buttons be laid out, how will the HUD work, how does the menu system function, and so on. It is a good idea to insert photos, diagrams or concept art to help explain the UI.
